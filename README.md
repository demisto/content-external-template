# Getting Started

## Setting up the repository in Github
#### Creating new private repository

Press the `Use this Template` button and choose to fork the repository as private repository.

#### In case you already have a private repository

```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/demisto/content-external-template.git
cd content-external-template.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/yourname/private-repo.git
cd ..
rm -rf content-external-template.git
```

Clone the private repository so you can start working on it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/private-repo.git
cd private-repo
make some changes
git commit
git push origin master
```

## Adding `xsoar-bot` as a contributor

Follow [invite collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) guide.  

Invite `xsoar-bot` user.

## Setup your development environment

Follow [development setup](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/dev-setup) article

## Adding Your Pack

If you're not sure about the expected structure of this repo, you can run:

```bash
./tools/bootstrap.sh
```

The script will prompt you to select the [type of paid content](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/partners/premium-packs#what-can-be-in-a-premium-pack) and will accordingly create the necessary Pack format.


You can also review the [resell Pack structure](https://github.com/demisto/content-helloworld-premium/tree/master/Packs/HelloWorldPremium-Resell) and [premium Pack structure](https://github.com/demisto/content-helloworld-premium/tree/master/Packs/HelloWorldPremium) instead and use those to guide you what the Pack is expected to look like.


If you're familiar with the Pack format, you can jump to the **Create your first pack** section below. If not, see [Content Packs Structure](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/packs/packs-format)

### Create your first pack

Creating a pack is the same process as in the public repository. Follow the [Before you start](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/concepts/getting-started-guide#before-you-start-developing) and the [Contribution](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/contributing/contributing) guides that will help you to design, develop and test your work.

### Opening a Pull Request

- Make sure your work is done on a designated branch (**not `master`**). This will help us conduct a proper review of the pack.
- In your private repository [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) from the created branch to the master branch.
- When the pull request is ready for review, assign `xsoar-bot` and add the label `ready-for-review`. At this point we might ask you to invite and assign someone from the XSOAR content team members to review the pull request.
